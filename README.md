# Procedural Map Generation

https://hen1227.github.io/map-generation/

This is a 2D visualization of my method for generating random dungeons.
This will be expanded upon and used inside my Minecraft Dungeon generator.

The plan is to have a bunch of rooms pre-built in Minecraft, then place them down door-to-door and connect tunnels to the remaining doors.
This is the first step in the process of creating a procedural dungeon generator for Minecraft.
